It also takes like 20 minutes to fill out the forms, create fax-compatible sized screenshots and a lot of other boilerplate information if you plan to contest the dispute.<p>It&#x27;s a shame Stripe doesn&#x27;t offer the Radar service (helps detect and prevent fraud) with custom rules as part of their normal service. You can only get it if you pay insurance fees, which are added fees on top of the normal amount.<p>Combine that with the new Stripe SCA compatible APIs and sketchy docs and yeah I&#x27;m in the same boat as you. Stripe is no longer an immediate &quot;of course I&#x27;m going to use Stripe&quot; decision. Braintree is looking pretty good at this point.","time":1587051374,"type":"comment"}
