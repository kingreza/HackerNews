The profit in a small business goes to the owner(s), who usually live somewhere in the local community, and in turn that money stays within the community to be spent on other businesses there.<p>When a Walmart comes along, the profits all move up the chain to a corporation that is nowhere nearby, effectively sucking the wealth out of small towns in exchange for slightly reduced costs thanks to efficient logistics.<p>The happy medium would be to find a way to have logistics as good as Walmart without having to actually be Walmart.","time":1587052026,"type":"comment"}
