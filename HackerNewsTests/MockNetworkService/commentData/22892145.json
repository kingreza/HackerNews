The true cost to stipe is a fraction of a penny to put the request on to the network.  Other processors will refund interchange, this is unique to stripe.   I am\nsure stripe is refunding interchange for their larger merchants that are on interchange plus billing. There is no way target is eating interchange on refunds.  They are squeezing their smaller merchants for more money.","time":1587062030,"type":"comment"}
