I know it&#x27;s probably intellectual property and secret sauce, but imagine:<p>&quot;Since US Covid shutdown (as of March 13th) Stripe US processing volume is up X% or $Y billion.&quot;<p>This general information would provide great context to the health of the US economy and e-commerce. I know other companies such as payroll processing (ADP) release numbers and the stock market uses those as an input to the health of the economy.","time":1587056027,"type":"comment"}
