I signed up for an authorize.net account through a merchant account called Capital Merchant Systems (later acquired by EVO Payments).  At the time, the process required filling out a pile of paperwork, including writing an actual cover letter to get approved.<p>Things were fine until recent years, business for this particular service had slowly dropped to the point where it was no longer feasible to run through authorize.net.  So I decided to finally make the switch over to Stripe (which I&#x27;d used for a number of years on another project).<p>Signing up for Stripe is so painlessly easy, straightforward, and friendly.<p>After switching my system over, I called and emailed my merchant account to cancel (this was in August). Then I called and emailed again in November.  Then I called and emailed again in January.<p>All the while, they&#x27;ve been withdrawing from my checking account.<p>Then I emailed again in April, and filed reports with the BBB and FTC.  Only then have I heard back from them, and they&#x27;re claiming my January request is the first request.<p>So the short of it is, use Stripe. They are amazing, open, and transparent, their API is a joy to work with, and their dashboard is great. I wish Stripe was around 16 years ago when I first got started processing payments.<p>And DO NOT, under any circumstances, use EVO Payments. Cancelling with them is like cancelling a shitty gym membership - at the end of the day, you&#x27;ll have to file complaints with every 3-letter organization you can think of, and file transaction disputes to cancel your account.","time":1587066097,"type":"comment"}
