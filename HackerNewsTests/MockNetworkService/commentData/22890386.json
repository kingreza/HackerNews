I did some math and PayPal offers a better deal for Canadian businesses after Stripe bumps me off of their grandfathered conversion fees in a couple months.<p>I love the slick interface, but it&#x27;s simply not worth the thousands per year I&#x27;ll be saving with the switch.<p>For me the main selling point for any payment processor is the minimization of fees. Sure, the API&#x27;s are nice, but I already use a payment gateway for that.<p>I&#x27;m a few clicks away from saving thousands. Am I missing anything?","time":1587050904,"type":"comment"}
