One of the reasons why it’s hard to get us to use a CC is that many of us don’t have credit cards. And why would we? (Except for online payments and other fringe cases.)<p>However, Stripe offers SEPA direct debit, which is usable with any European bank account and may work better for you.<p>EDIT: This seems to have sparked some confusion. I&#x27;m not saying Germans don&#x27;t do card payments, I was only speaking of <i>credit</i> cards.
