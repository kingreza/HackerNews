This bank account can either be with a Canadian bank, or a US bank.<p>Source: I work at Stripe, but in addition to that, previously started a Canadian company using Stripe, and like you did mostly payments to US customers in USD. I had deposits directly into both a USD bank account held at a Canadian bank as well as a USD bank account held at a US bank, and did not pay the 2% conversion fee. I actually never received CAD directly at all.<p>More details: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;payouts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;payouts</a><p>But yes, other than certain exceptions such as this one, getting payouts in non-local currencies on Stripe is limited, and we&#x27;re working on improving that.<p>(edit: This assumes you have expenses in USD, or a cheap way to convert USD to CAD, to avoid a ~2% fee from your bank on the conversion. Personally I&#x27;ve used Interactive Brokers which charges 0.002% for USD&#x2F;CAD conversions.)","time":1587071746,"type":"comment"}
