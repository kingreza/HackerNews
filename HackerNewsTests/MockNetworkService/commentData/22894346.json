But I don&#x27;t have a credit card and most of my peers &#x2F; family doesn&#x27;t have one either. Our debit cards will usually not work for on-line payments (the type that requires card number + cvv).   \nWe do, however, have a widely adopted system called Blik[1], which is instant mobile payments (incl. POS payments, the terminals are adopted to process it, and many ATMs support cash withdrawals via Blik). I think it would be hard for any payments processor to get significant market share here without support for this, for many it&#x27;s the default, then I think wire tranfer is the 2nd option, shopping elsewhere the third one, card payment maaaybe the 4th choice.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polskistandardplatnosci.pl&#x2F;en&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polskistandardplatnosci.pl&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>","time":1587077151,"type":"comment"}
