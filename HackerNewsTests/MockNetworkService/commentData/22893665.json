We&#x27;ve loved using Stripe for years, but given all of the uncertainty surrounding the tipsi-stripe project and the lack of an official stripe solution for React-Native, we&#x27;re questioning how wise it is to be dependant on Stripe. I&#x27;ve seen others speaking to your staff on twitter and github about this, so I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re alone.<p>There must be hundreds (thousands?) of apps using this integration and all of them have been stuck in limbo for many months now. We would like to enable SCA, but the beta version of this project doesn&#x27;t seem to have documentation beyond a few comments in github issues here and there, and the discord is almost solely populated by people asking how to use the beta and no one can answer them.<p>I think whichever of the major payment platforms extends a hand out to the React-Native community first, with a confident, well documented official project, will be celebrated and would cement themselves as THE payment platform for people using React-Native.","time":1587071825,"type":"comment"}
