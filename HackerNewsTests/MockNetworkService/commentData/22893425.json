Our agents are working as best as they can, but our tools were never really designed for 5000+ tickets to be active at 1 time, so it&#x27;s slow going for them as they contact the guest, then contact the provider, then talk to the guest, etc.<p>Are you going to offer some lenience to companies who have gotten a huge spike in charge backs just due to an increase time in support tickets?<p>We are trying to find ways to just refund the guest where we know the hotel has closed, but there&#x27;s no master list of that so we can&#x27;t just blindly refund everybody","time":1587070388,"type":"comment"}
