I always get told either &quot;soon&quot;, or &quot;not possible due to the law&quot;, despite competitors doing it.<p>2) If we were an EU company, we&#x27;d get charged 1.4%+25c on transactions in the EU, where most of our customers are. Instead, because we&#x27;re selling from Australia, we get charged 2.9% for some arbitrary reason. This coupled with 1) puts our all-in transaction fees at 5%+ :(<p>3) I think billing the vendor for refund fees is a really retrograde step - it increases friction in the decision for us when a customer asks for a refund, and industry wide is going to cause less happy customers and less card users online. It&#x27;s already hard enough convincing Dutch&#x2F;German customers to use a credit card online.<p>If any non-EU companies know a cheaper way to process transactions in the EU, I&#x27;m all ears...","time":1587055508,"type":"comment"}
