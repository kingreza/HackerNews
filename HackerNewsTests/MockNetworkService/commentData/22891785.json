We charge customers in USD but we are forced to convert to SGD and conversion fees adds up. On 99USD charge, with the current conversion, we get around 138 SGD but the net for us is 133 SGD because the processing fee is ~5.20SGD. That fee was lower before.\nThere is no problem for us getting an extension of our account in USD currency so we could avoid unnecessary conversion USD-&gt;SGD fees.<p>2. Chargebacks. A real pain in the ass. I shared a post on IH about it. Basically there is no way for us to issue someone a refund if they are doing a chargeback. This is a real problem that is relatively easy to solve. PayPal does it - basically, if the customer submits dispute, PayPal first tries to contact the seller to voluntarily provide the refund and only if they refuse, the dispute is being reviewed. Why Stripe cannot work this way? That would save a lot of drama and stress involved running the business for both sides - you and us, your customers.<p>3. Pricing info. It&#x27;s still very confusing on your website to understand what and how you charge for particular add-ons and whether we are grandfathered and have these add-on services included free of charge (since we have been with you since 2016).","time":1587059289,"type":"comment"}
