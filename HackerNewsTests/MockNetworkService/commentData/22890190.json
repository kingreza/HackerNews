It is confusing and counterintuitive because people wonder why the &quot;valuation is stretched&quot; when literally just someone bought some shares, its not really news that someone bought shares at a high price. &quot;Jonathan bought 1 share of Amazon for $2,000 for a valuation of 1.5 trillion&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter if this was a secondary market trade, or Amazon doing a 1 share secondary offering &quot;raising $2000&quot;, it is a completely non news story, except in how the private equity world chooses to warp the language.<p>In private equity, the &quot;rounds&quot; have to be a higher valuation, and a &quot;down round&quot; is bad - an instant death knell and death spiral for the company solely because of how the PE world chooses to broadcast clout.","time":1587049923,"type":"comment"}
