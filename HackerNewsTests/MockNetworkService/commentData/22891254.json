(I assume you are using Braintree.)<p>Honestly, you are the first person to make a good case on using PayPal over Stripe. Especially with the arbitrary horror stories I hear about PayPal all the time.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a shame Stripe doesn&#x27;t offer the Radar service (helps detect and prevent fraud) with custom rules as part of their normal service. You can only get it if you pay insurance fees, which are added fees on top of the normal amount.<p>I agree. This should be standard.<p>&gt; Combine that with the new Stripe SCA compatible APIs and sketchy docs<p>Would you please describe what is sketchy? Their docs seem pretty good... but I am now just hearing about SCA.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;strong-customer-authentication\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;strong-customer-authentication</a>","time":1587055854,"type":"comment"}
