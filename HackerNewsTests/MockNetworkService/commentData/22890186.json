We used to grocery shop small orders every 2 days or so. Sometimes daily.<p>Now we are trying to minimize going out at all. So we&#x27;ve been using instacart and shipt for over a month and it&#x27;s a big time saver. So I expect we will continue to use them once we are in a more normal state.<p>So I expect lots of people will keep using them just because it saves time.<p>I think normal is going to be way out like 18 months at least and probably longer.<p>Even at that point we&#x27;re probably going to be minimizing crowds and shopping in stores. And we&#x27;re definitely going to be shopping less frequently and larger grocery orders.<p>This event will change how a large % of us lives and shops for a long time.","time":1587049901,"type":"comment"}
