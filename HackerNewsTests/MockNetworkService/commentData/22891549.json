Both are great companies that have grown into larger players. However, they still only account for a non material portion of total transaction value and volume when it comes to commerce. Therefore, they can be caught to in many areas. Take for example stripe. They are almost exclusively online and offer a bundled transaction rate. By simply focusing on areas like offline payments or more flexible&#x2F;customizable rates a company could easily beat them.<p>For PayPal, they are much larger, you could do the same. You will not beat them over night but you can easily find niches where a more tailored approach would benefit the businesses rather than the broad strokes a company of that size has to take.<p>One area to look at for both would be online sales. Neither do that well at all. Another area to consider would be embedded experiences that require micro transactions. Stripe and PayPal are all but wedded to the payment networks at this time.","time":1587057798,"type":"comment"}
