A couple local breweries, a coffee roaster, and another place I ordered car parts from. As soon as you enter a coupon code, the ApplePay option goes away. I am trying to remember why, I want to say, the ApplePay option shows up BEFORE the checkout page where you enter coupon codes, then once you enter a code you can no longer ApplePay. \nAnyone else notice this?","time":1587055264,"type":"comment"}
