You own a widget-making company, and they&#x27;re very successful: you get a profit of $1 for each widget sold, and each widget factory produces 1 million widgets per year. You currently have one factory, for a profit of $1M&#x2F;year, and a new factory costs $8M to build. Suppose that four factories are enough to supply the world&#x27;s widget needs, in which case you&#x27;ll eventually be making $4M&#x2F;year.<p>If you don&#x27;t raise any money at all, you&#x27;ll be able to build a second factory after 8 years, a third factory after 4 years, and a fourth factory after another 2 years. At that point you&#x27;re making $4M&#x2F;year and no longer expanding. Hooray! After 14 years of putting all the profits into making new factories, you can enjoy watching the money flow in.<p>Now suppose you were able to convince investors to give you $24M to build three more factories immediately, in exchange for some percentage of the business. You&#x27;re <i>immediately</i> making $4M&#x2F;year, minus whatever percentage goes to your investors. If the percentage that the investors get is low enough, this has a higher net present value to you than the slow-and-steady approach described in the previous paragraph.<p>Now what if investors aren&#x27;t convinced enough to give you $24M, but they <i>will</i> give you enough ($8M) to make one factory? Well, you could open that factory, show investors that you&#x27;re making double the profits now, and maybe that&#x27;ll convince them to invest more now that your business has proven itself. There may even be multiple rounds of this. The rationale is the same: by expanding your business faster, you expand your revenue faster.","time":1587068782,"type":"comment"}
