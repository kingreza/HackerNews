I just said we don&#x27;t use <i>credit</i> cards, we use debit cards instead which come by default with any standard bank account. However, these cards are neither MasterCard nor Visa and therefore do not work in online payment scenarios.<p>I have a credit card, but it is paid in full at the end of the month automatically, so for all intents and purposes it&#x27;s essentially another debit card. Everyone I know in Germany who has a credit card uses it this way. In fact, my bank didn&#x27;t even ask me if I wanted it set up any differently, so I have to imagine it&#x27;s not just my social circle handling it this way.","time":1587064284,"type":"comment"}
