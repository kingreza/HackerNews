Especially B2C which we are. Customers can arbitrarily chargeback even after several days. Not only that, they can ask for a refund, get the refund and then charge back. So we end up paying them! And there’s no way to prevent it. At least that’s the way it was a few years ago when stripe sepa was still beta.<p>The interesting thing however, we A&#x2F;B tested with and without SEPA and basically saw no difference. Only German people used it, but when it wasn’t available they managed to find a credit card or use PayPal.<p>I’d love it if banks were making instant payments simple and verifiable, but SEPA feels like something from the 70s to me.","time":1587064212,"type":"comment"}
