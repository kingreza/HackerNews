They did approve me for a loan but want a fee upfront + a slice of daily sales until its paid back.<p>Genuine question... is the interest really the major issue with the loan they offered?<p>The amount of interest in the “slice of daily sales” is not that much (relatively speaking). That slice is just a loan repayment, which you would have to do whether it was interest free or not.<p>Maybe Stripe could do something like temporarily lower their fees or maybe reduce the up front fee, but I imagine that their current loan offer to you isn’t far from what you would get even if they had a net zero expected value from your loan.<p>Am I missing something?","time":1587052818,"type":"comment"}
