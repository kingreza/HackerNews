In case it&#x27;s useful, some context on them:<p>On (1), we started an FX team this year. (There are a lot of legal complexities here around how the funds move, who has title to what at which moment, and so on.) But we&#x27;re investing significantly in improving it and it should get better soon. On (2), the core issue is card network pricing rules -- by design, they discriminate on the basis of where the business is located. We happily extend EU fees to all EU legal entities, however, and would be happy to work with you to set that up. On (3), refunds aren&#x27;t free for Stripe, and we were previously in a position where businesses with a lot of refunds were being subsidized by those who didn&#x27;t. We want to give this margin away more sensibly.<p>Still, all the issues you bring up are real and I&#x27;d like us to find better solutions.","time":1587056227,"type":"comment"}
