If you aren&#x27;t deemed essential, you&#x27;re likely going out of business as your market is eaten up by Amazon and Target&#x2F;Walmart (which get to keep selling various non essentials since they&#x27;re allowed to remain open, so they can sell groceries and drugs). Small local businesses will fail or take out crushing loans from the govt, and your mom+pop kitchen store is not more able to cope than Target with its well staffed IT dept, unbroken revenue stream, and deep pockets.","time":1587058464,"type":"comment"}
