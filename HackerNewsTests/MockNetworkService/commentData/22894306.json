The React Native situation is very much top-of-mind and we&#x27;re working on the right lasting solution for your business and the RN community.<p>When we had submitted the PRs to provide 3D Secure &#x2F; SCA support, we had not anticipated the work would be left on an experimental branch for this amount of time.<p>This spring we&#x27;ve been able to connect with the previous maintainers and understand the business situation behind this community repo. With all things open source, we want to be mindful of projects that are run by the community while determining which key libraries not in active development&#x2F;maintenance.<p>All this to say, peace of mind and clarity on how React Native devs can implement Stripe with ease is a priority and I apologize for the limbo you&#x27;ve been in.<p>Thank you so much for your patience as we pull the remediation together.<p>Happy to chat directly as well -&gt; trag at stripe dot com","time":1587076815,"type":"comment"}
