So massive thanks for that.<p>We had one hick-up, which was the fault of a wrong PHP setting and we got several duplicate orders as a result. In the stripe dashboard I could clearly see failed webhooks in the post mortem. So if there were some kind of email alarm if an error threshold is exceeded that would be nice. I did not find any such feature, if I should have missed it please point me towards the right direction. Cheers.","time":1587067741,"type":"comment"}
