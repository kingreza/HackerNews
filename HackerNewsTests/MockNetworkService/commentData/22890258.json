Some businesses in Stripe are seeing huge surges in demand and others are seeing major shortfalls. In either case, we want to make sure we can that we can be relied on to provide flawless service.<p>- Keeping up with the surge of new customers. A lot of businesses are migrating online and many of the platforms we serve are also seeing significant spikes in signups. So, we&#x27;re investing a lot of effort in making sure that we can scale effectively there and remove all unnecessary friction. (There&#x27;s a very active project working on cleaning up our docs and improving the integration experience, for example.)<p>- Adding support for business models that were previously limited because of bank&#x2F;card network restrictions. We just launched support for telemedicine last week.<p>- Figuring out ways to help businesses by enabling access to government programs (e.g. the PPP program in the US). These programs usually haven&#x27;t thought much about the somewhat unique characteristics of online businesses. We&#x27;re trying to help government officials understand what internet businesses need. (And, per the comment elsewhere in this thread, we&#x27;re rolling out our first PPP loans this week.)","time":1587050291,"type":"comment"}
