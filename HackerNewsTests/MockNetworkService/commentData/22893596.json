{"by":"kerkeslager","id":22893596,"parent":22890386,"text":"From the user&#x27;s perspective:<p>A few (maybe 5 or 6?) years back I suddenly stopped being able to add or withdraw money through PayPal, with a completely vague description. Multiple hours on support documents and attempting to contact support (which is a problem in itself) and the problem was not resolved. I wasn&#x27;t that invested in buying what I was trying to buy, so I eventually gave up. I&#x27;ve tried again a few times over the years, with no success.<p>When I see PayPal on a site nowadays and either no other options or I don&#x27;t trust them to process the card themselves, I just leave. If this is the sort of effect that could harm your business it may be worth it to pay for a payment processor that works for all your users.<p>I also have a $0.49 balance in PayPal which I can&#x27;t withdraw. I don&#x27;t care, but if it were a larger amount I probably would.","time":1587071381,"type":"comment"}
