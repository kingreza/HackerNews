As my business grew and I looked at where I could cut costs, I asked around and Braintree&#x27;s model was going to save me 1% per transaction. At my volume that was going to add up to thousands of dollars in savings a month over Stripe. I went back to Stripe to see if they&#x27;d be willing to match Braintree&#x27;s pricing, because I was happy with them over the years and it would have made things much easier to not have to switch to a new payment processor. But they only offered about 75% of the savings so I switched anyway. Turns out the APIs are roughly the same anyway for the basic functionality that I need, I&#x27;m not an advanced user. I estimate the switch has already saved me about $75k.","time":1587052978,"type":"comment"}
