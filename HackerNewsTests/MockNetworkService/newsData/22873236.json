I have a background in backend&#x2F;data engineering and Machine Learning, but have not worked on front end technologies and design. I&#x27;m wondering if there are any tools that are recommended for designing web and mobile apps. I&#x27;m specifically looking for suggestions to create front end elements, style sheets etc using some kind of WYSIWYG interface to begin with before hiring engineers.<p>PS: I&#x27;m also looking for co-founders - please reach out to me if you are interested in learning more and talking out about education technology.","time":1586911823,"title":"Ask HN: Tools/Editors to Create User Interface","type":"story"}
