It&#x27;s DPI and not a proxy.<p>Last month, received a C&amp;D from lawyers of a co that holds trademark over the e word. So far, I have agreed to remove all use of the word except in a descriptive context and the time has come to sign an agreement with the other co.<p>The proposed agreement is perpetual. My lawyers strongly suspect the other co would refuse to agree to include a term that the agreement terminates after a set period of time, or if they were to lose all of their registered trademark rights in that word. Lawyers are funded by an insurance policy I had luckily taken out and bill every 6 minutes of their time.<p>Should I push back on the perpetuity of this agreement? Should I get a second opinion?","time":1587074513,"title":"Ask HN: Cease & Desist on using the word egress. Sign it away for eternity?","type":"story"}
