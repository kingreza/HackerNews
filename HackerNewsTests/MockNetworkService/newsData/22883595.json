In the UK, where I&#x27;m based, it means that although I&#x27;m still an employee of my company, the government pays 80% of my salary and I&#x27;m not allowed to do any work.<p>Paired with the fact I&#x27;m starting grad school in Boston in a few months, I would love to help anybody out on their projects&#x2F;businesses wherever I can and where ever I can be of use. For free - I don&#x27;t expect or want any pay.<p>So my question to you all is, do you need any help?<p>Before today I was working day to day as a designer in architecture and construction and was just about to start working on a project for Google in London (the contract didn&#x27;t go through because of the pandemic situation).<p>So my main skills are in design. Drawing, Adobe, 3D Modelling, 3D printing, design thinking, prototyping, design sprints. All that good stuff.<p>However over the past year I have also began designing and building my own programs, so am very comfortable with sketch, invision, figma and the processes of wireframing etc. I can also code in the classic web dev languages from HTML to PHP and although I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m comfortable yet I can hack together bits and pieces in React Native and Rails.<p>So whatever it may be, let me know!<p>Cheers,\nJames<p>more at:\njamesstirrat.com","time":1586987979,"title":"Ask HN: Does anybody need any help?","type":"story"}
